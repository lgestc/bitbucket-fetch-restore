Chrome extension to solve single Bitbucket annoyance

## What it does?
It appends `git fetch && git checkout` to a branch name created with Bitbucket.

## How to install this?
Dowload the code as `zip` archive and load it up with Chrome (need to enable `developer mode` on extensions pane probably).
